# HK Conditions Monitor (super simple)

Everything is inside `app.py`. No TOML files, no database, just random mock data printed to the console.

## How to run
```bash
cd hk_monitor
python app.py
```

When the console shows up:
- Enter: refresh the data
- c: change district / station / region
- q: quit
